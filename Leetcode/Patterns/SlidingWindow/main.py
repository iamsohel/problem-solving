# The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies a specific condition, 
# optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of elements.
# Use this pattern when dealing with problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

# Sample Problem:
# Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.

# Example:

# Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3

# Output: 9

# Explanation:
# Start with the sum of the first k elements.

# Slide the window one element at a time, 
# subtracting the element that goes out of the window and adding the new element.

# Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
# start with l,r. increase r till condition is true. increase l when condition is false and remove first l.
